# SwiftUI-Basics
Swift UI is a declarative UI framework from Apple which lets developers write UI code in a new and better way than UIKit. As Apple says “Better Apps Less Code”, we can use Swift UI to create user interface by writing less code and good thing is that we just need to write one code and it will work on every platform.
